# CL_Project_My_Crazy_Website

Hello. This is my first front end development project & I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn something new.

I tried to choose something uncomplicated as this is literally like learning 3 foreign languages at the same time. Even learning new language such as a 'repository' and 'commits'
was foreign, but I'm gaining confidence. I even accidentally deleted my GitBash the night before this project was due and was anxious that I wouldn't be able to update my 
repository but I surprised myself and found the path back.

I enjoy being outdoors and nature therefore I wanted to share that a bit with fulfilling the project requirements without further getting in over my head.

I had a difficult time learning the logic initially but the more I practice and read down the rabbit hole, the more I am able to connect the dots faster for styling/user purposes. 

I created my project to have flex from desktop to mobile however I notice there is scroll-ability left<>right on the mobile view and unfamiliar with how to correct at this time.

I also attempted to add hamburger menu that flexes but it changed the styling of my boxes and took them off center and was unable to determine how to correct that
once the media queries and hamburger menu were added.

I attempted to add image carousel with pictures I've taken in my backyard however I am unable to get the images to show correctly.

I created a form with two inputs in effort to keep interested viewers coming back to see updated images and new educational info as it would be my intention to add to image
collection over time...

That pretty much wraps up my first web site and my very first experience to a learning experience like this. Hope you can appreciate the effort. Thanks for your time.
